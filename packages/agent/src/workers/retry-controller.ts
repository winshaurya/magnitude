/**
 * RetryController Worker (Forked)
 *
 * Drives the retry-after-delay path for ConnectionFailure outcomes.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Cortex publishes a turn_outcome with _tag='ConnectionFailure'.
 *   2. TurnProjection enqueues a chain_continue trigger with notBefore set to
 *      the future timestamp at which the next retry is allowed.
 *   3. This worker observes the same turn_outcome event, reads the trigger's
 *      notBefore from the projection, sleeps until that moment, then publishes
 *      a wake event. The wake causes onProjectionsSettled to re-evaluate, at
 *      which point TurnController sees the trigger is now due and fires
 *      turn_started.
 *
 * Cancellation:
 *   The worker is forked, so its sleep is automatically interrupted on user
 *   interrupt (via Worker.defineForked's built-in interrupt coordinator) and
 *   on agent_killed / subagent_user_killed / subagent_idle_closed via
 *   forkLifecycle.completeOn.
 *
 * The cap (MAX_RETRIES) is enforced in Cortex by transforming the outcome
 * before publishing — see workers/cortex.ts. This worker only ever sees
 * pre-cap ConnectionFailure outcomes, so it always sleeps and wakes.
